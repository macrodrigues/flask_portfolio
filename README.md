# My portfolio page

This is the repository of my portfolio page.

This repository is always in construction, since from time to time I add or remove projects, change styles, etc.

This project was deployed on GCP using Zeet as DevOps software for easy deployment.

If you want to know more about Zeet, check my medium article:
